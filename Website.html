          <h2>A Good Website</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> I have identified six main features that I consider essential for a good website.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> 1)	The website must have a clear purpose, so that anyone looking at it will immediately understand that we are aiming to sell a scientific research product, what kind of product it is and who we are. Therefore, the site must me themed to fit the product. This website achieves this by being divided into clear sections that describe the product and the team, as well as having a company logo. The other features also all contribute to tailoring the website to the product.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> 2)	The website must appeal to the right target audience, meaning that the designer needs to understand the needs of the customers. Our target audience is the scientific research community. To appeal to them, we include detailed technological information of our product and use a factual approach to explain its relevance.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> 3)	It is very important to navigate a website quickly and easily. Any customer would be put off if they get lost within the website. Here, all the product and company information is on one page, so that the only navigation for a customer is scrolling. To access additional information, return to the home page or jump to certain subsections, the website user can easily find links at the top of each page.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> 4)	A pleasant appearance is perhaps the most critical aspect of website design. The font, colour scheme and image-to-text-ratio will be the first impression any customer gets and is likely to shape their overall experience. This site uses a clean, simple font as a style that would fit the scientific community. Th colour scheme is primarily blue, white and grey, to reflect the clean, sterile environment of a biological wet lab. High resolution images were used to imply a high-quality product. The amount of text and images was balanced by empty space to make sure that the customer does not feel crowded and overwhelmed.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> 5)	A fast loading speed is very important to ensure that customers do not get impatient and decide to buy from a different company instead.  Often the network connection is the controlling factor and is not something the website designer can control. But having a neat code and few links and videos can reduce waiting time.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> 6)	Finally, the most important aspect of a website, in my opinion is being accessible to and easy to find for everyone. These points are discussed in the next sections.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 my-auto showcase-text">
          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> Anyone should be able to access a website if they wish to do so. This should be unhindered by any form of disability. In the UK, the Equality Act 2010 provides a legal basis to protect people from discrimination and includes requirements that websites must meet. According to the UK government, 1 in 5 people have a disability, highlighting the importance of being inclusive.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> Disabilities may include visual, hearing, motor and cognitive impairment. The visual category ranges from complete blindness to poor eyesight and includes colour blindness. Similarly, hearing covers total deafness to mild hearing loss. Motor impairments are those that affect control over body part, an example being hand tremors. Cognitive disabilities include a wide range of different conditions, such as autism, Down Syndrome, dementia, Attention Deficit Disorder, and dyslexia.  </p>
          <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> However, accessibility is not only affected by disabilities, but also location, health, and equipment. For example, someone in a night club who tired after a long day of work, and potentially slightly drunk, may look at a website on their mobile phone. This person is likely to have a very different experience and therefore different requirement, than someone sitting at their compute in a quiet office at 9am after their cup of coffee.</p>
