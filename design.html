            <h3>Website Design Tools</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0"  align="justify">This website was designed using 3 basic tools. First, the Start Bootstrap Theme “Landing Page” was downloaded from the open source collection to serve as a starting template. This was chosen because Start Bootstrap has many simple but elegant designs, that are pleasant to look at and easy to navigate. The Landing Page theme appeared most appropriate for promoting the BactoViewer product. Second, this original theme was edited in the Atom software. This is a free open-source editor which is supported by the main operating systems (Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux), so that it is convenient to use in situations. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, it is a very user-friendly editor, especially for someone with very little coding experience. Atom comes with a GitHub package, which is the third step. Github was used to host the source code and to publish it. This service is very straight forward to use, free of cost, and has effective features, such as access control, distributed version control and wikis.</p>
