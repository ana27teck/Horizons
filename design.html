            <h3>Website Design Tools</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify"> This website was designed using 3 basic tools.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">First, the Start Bootstrap Theme “Landing Page” was downloaded from the open source collection to serve as a starting template. This was chosen because Start Bootstrap has many simple but elegant designs, that are pleasant to look at and easy to navigate. The Landing Page theme appeared most appropriate for promoting the BactoViewer product.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">Second, this original theme was edited in the Atom software. This is a free open-source editor which is supported by the main operating systems (Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux), so that it is convenient to use in situations. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, it is a very user-friendly editor, especially for someone with very little coding experience.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">Atom comes with a GitHub package, which is the third step. Github was used to host the source code and to publish it. This service is very straight forward to use, free of cost, and has effective features, such as access control, distributed version control and wikis.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <div class="features-icons-item mx-auto mb-5 mb-lg-0 mb-lg-3">
            <div class="features-icons-icon d-flex">
              <i class="icon-globe m-auto text-primary"></i>
            </div>
            <h3>Domain Name</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">The domain name is the unique address of this website and allows anyone to open it on the world wide web. The domain name of the home of this website is https://ana27teck.github.io/Horizons/. This name is based on my GitHub user name (ana27teck) and the name of the repository (Horizons). It also reflects that GitHub was used to publish the website.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">If this project were to develop into a real business, we would purchase a domain that reflects the company name and/or the product, e.g. “bactoview”, and set it as a custom domain with GitHub Pages. The most common domain suffix is .com, which is for commercial businesses and would apply to this website. However, .com is relatively expensive to purchase, so that .co.uk may be an option if we are only aiming for the UK market, but would be limiting if planning to grow into an international company. To purchase a domain name, one has to register it with ICAAN  (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) through a domain name registrar.</p>
